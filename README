SR-IOV enabler

This script creates SR-IOV virtual functions on specified interface and creates
a network in libvirt which will later expand to various virtual functions. It
was written specically for interfaces drived by igb mod(Intel 82575/6, 82580,
I350, and I210/211-Based Gigabit Network Connections, full list at [1]). But
with a little revise you can adapt it to your interface with different driver.
For revising, see [2], [3].

Usage: sr-iov-enable.sh <physical function>
